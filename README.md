### General Information
This project was exactly what I needed. You have a text area that takes in strings and uses split to create many strings and return them in an array. In the application, those "string items" are shown to the user as options, and when the user presses enter, a random item is chosen. This was done with the setInterval method that cycled 30 times before using a math.random function to choose one. I really was happy to do this project, especially right now, as I have been working on projects where I was struggling to write the functionailty, and I can now use what I learned here to create it.
